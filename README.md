The VHS Tape Categorization Tool lets you organize your collection of VHS tapes. You can organize your
tapes into categories. Leave comments, and add descriptions and genres for your tapes. VTCT is your one
stop shop for organzing your collection of tapes. 

Create and account and log in. Start with VHSTapes. Here you can add a bulk list of all the VHS tapes in
your movie collection. Adding a "collection" property to your VHS tape listing will automatically create
a "collection". You can also manually create a collection without first creating any VHS tapes for it to
contain. 

When inside of the "Collections" section, remember to click the "details" button to see comments that
people have left about your collections. To create a comment of your own, take note of the collection ID.
Go to "Comments" and click "Add New Comment". Add your comment along with the collection ID you noted earlier.
This will add your comment to the appropriate collection. 

Also inside of "Collections", again, remember to click the "details" button to see the individual VHS tapes
that make up a collection. The front page of "Collections" is simply a list of collections. But clicking on
"details" will show you the actual contents of each collection.

Planned features for future updates:

1. Show collections and their contents all on one page.
2. Add a feature to add comments on individual VHS tapes and lists of VHS tapes
3. Add user roles for added functionalit
4. Link to Internet Movie Database or other repository for more information on individual VHS tapes
